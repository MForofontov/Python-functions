 # Python Functions

This repository, **MForofontov/Python-functions**, contains a comprehensive set of Python functions organized by type. The goal is to provide a collection of reusable code snippets for various programming tasks. Below is an overview of the repository:

## Contents

- **String Functions**: Functions for string manipulation, such as formatting, parsing, and validation.
- **Math Functions**: Mathematical operations including algebra, calculus, and statistical calculations.
- **File Handling**: Functions to read, write, and manipulate files and directories.
- **Data Structures**: Implementations of common data structures like lists, stacks, queues, and dictionaries.
- **Date and Time**: Functions to handle date and time operations, including formatting and calculations.
- **Network Utilities**: Functions for network operations such as HTTP requests and socket programming.

## Usage

Each function is documented with its purpose, input parameters, and output. Examples are provided to demonstrate how to use the functions effectively.

## Unit Tests

This repository uses `pytest` for unit testing to ensure the reliability and correctness of the functions. The tests are organized by the type of function they cover. To run the tests, use the following command:

```sh
pytest
```
